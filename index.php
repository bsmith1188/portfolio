		<p class="col-sm-12" id="intro">I am a junior fullstack developer graduated from the CNM STEMulus Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp where I learned... well how to do this! If it weren't for them you wouldn't be reading this right now and I'd still be painting houses out in the sun. I have wanted to do stuff like this since I was a kid. I even took classes in middle school where I learned how to write basic commands in chipmunk basic. I was so excited to be able to make something using code that for an in class assignment that was only supposed to be over a couple days I actually spent tons of freetime on the weekend and after class just to draw a picture using coordinates. From there as I went through high school I took 4 years of computer graphics where I went over stuff from photoshop to some really simple coding stuff that was hyper limited though so I was a little disappointed until we started working with 3D wireframe models. It was amazing to see and learn how that stuff works. From making something as simple as a screw to a full character model and making it animate based on distance over time. Now that I actually know how to code some stuff a few friends and I are going to try to work at making some small scale video games by learning some new coding languages. Eventually I want to get into full scale game creation and development.</p>
